    The focus of my work at the Intelligent Enterprise CoE were complex technical solutions to make distributed machine learning processes more feasible and easily accessible to data scientists.
    During my time at Innovative Business Solutions I participated in various customer projetcs, where I gathered customer requirements and transferred those into high quality custom software solutions. The key projects were mainly located in the retail industry, whereupon I also got in contact with other industry branches.
