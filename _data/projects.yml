    lazycluster is an open source Python library intended to liberate data scientists and machine learning engineers by abstracting away cluster management and configuration so that they are able to focus on their actual tasks. Especially, the easy and convenient cluster setup with Python for various distributed machine learning frameworks is emphasized. This project is part of the ml-tooling open source organization which aims to develop tools that help developers being more productive in delivering machine learning solutions for their products and datasets.
