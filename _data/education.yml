    The dual bachelor program at FHDW gave me the possibility to deepen my technical and as well my practical knowledge in an professional academic environment. In addition I could strengthen and intensify my knowledge through my time as a working student at [Gahrens + Battermann GmbH](https://www.gb-mediensysteme.de/). Furthermore, I could improve my business knowledge, although the main focus of the studies were software engineering.
