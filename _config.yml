  Hi, my name is Jan and I'm a software engineer and tech enthusiast currently working as a freelancer. I have a diverse tech skill set based on multiple years of experience in custom development projects inside and outside of the SAP ecosystem. Additionally, I can demonstrate a solid foundation in more research oriented topics like data science or distributed systems for example. I am used to collaborative, remote first work and I am passionate about a self-responsible digital nomade lifestyle. I strongly believe in the power of teams consisting of highly skilled and passionate indivduals and love to work in such environments.

  Some technologies I touched in my life: 
    
  <mark>NestJS</mark> <mark>React</mark> <mark>MongoDB</mark> <mark>Apache Flink</mark> <mark>Apache Spark</mark> <mark>Apache Hadoop</mark> <mark>Neo4j</mark> <mark>Pandas</mark> <mark>Laravel</mark> <mark>SAPUI5</mark> <mark>HANA</mark>  <mark>SQL/NoSQL</mark> <mark>Java</mark>  <mark>ABAP</mark> <mark>GraphQL</mark> <mark>Rest</mark> <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Javascript</mark> <mark>Typescript</mark> <mark>HTML</mark> <mark>CSS</mark> <mark>PHP</mark> <mark>Other stuff I forgot to list ðŸ¤“</mark>
